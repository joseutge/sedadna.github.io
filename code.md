Code  of conduct

​

The sedaDNA scientific society is engaged to grow and evolve with its members. The society is committed to promoting an integrative, collaborative, open and diverse environment, while providing equity in opportunity and treatment. This is extended to all members regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, nationality or religion. We believe that building a community with a rich diversity within our membership will promote better science.

 

In this aspect, the sedaDNA scientific society is committed to reinforce the following principles:

    Avoid and reprimand discremination and harassment

    Insure and promote honest and respectful research

    Trust, respect, fairness and integrity in all activities offered by the society

 

The society reserves its right to refuse or ban a member who is or has been violating these principles.

 

Procedures for reporting inappropriate behaviour:

Any members of the sedaDNA scientific society who feels that they experience or witness harassment can report incidents to the board (sedimentarydna@gmail.com). In this case, the coordinator of the society would request recommendations from selected mediators about potential actions (warning, temporary suspension or permanent banning). Based on the recommendations, the board of the society would decide about engaging above listed actions. The reporting is important to ensure that the society pursues the principles listed above. There will be no-retaliation of the members who report harassment.

​

This code of conduct may evolve with the growth of the society.
