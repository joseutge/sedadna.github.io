<p>A PhD position at Umeå University on the topic : deoxygenation in past and modern coastal systems and effects on microbial metabolisms. See <a href="https://ericcapo.github.io/ericcapo/category/research.html" target="_blank"><u> here </u></a> for few words about the project. The candidate will work both with water and sediment (sedDNA) samples from Norwegian fjords, Baltic Sea and likely other systems of interests. Candidate should have interest and background in (aquatic) microbial ecology and some experiences in molecular ecology would be great (but not mandatory). See here for more information

<p>The School of Geography & Environmental Science at the University of Southampton is seeking to appoint a fill-time permanent Lecturer position focused on developing sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) research within the School. Disciplinary specialties such include (but are not limited to) limnology, biogeochemistry, freshwater and/or terrestrial ecosystems, spatial ecology, global environmental change, palaeoclimatology and Quaternary research. All the details can be found <a href="https://jobs.soton.ac.uk/Vacancy.aspx?id=36807&forced=2" target="_blank"><u> here </u></a>.</p>
  
  <b>Application deadline: 16th March 2023</b></p>

<p>The Sector Council for Research and Valorisation in Science and Techniques of ULiège provides a fellowship programme that supports qualified young incoming post-docs who want to develop their research at ULiege in Sciences, Technology, Engineering, Agro-Biotech, Materials (STEMA) and related disciplines for 2 years. See <a href="https://www.recherche.uliege.be/cms/c_13352123/en/ipd-stema" target="_blank"><u> https://www.recherche.uliege.be/cms/c_13352123/en/ipd-stema </u></a> and the Guide for applicants in appendix. 

We are looking for a suitable candidate interested to work in team of Annick Wilmotte, and if possible, with a link to the biodiversity of cyanobacteria in Polar Regions (projects <a href="https://www.belspo.be/belspo/brain2-be/projects/HabitAnt_E.pdf" target="_blank"><u> HabitANT </u></a> & Exposoils). It concerns scientists with PhD obtained after 1 October 2017 or being in a position to obtain his/ her doctoral degree before 15 September 2023.</p>
  
<p><b>The deadline for the call is 10 March 2023.</b></a></p>

<p>A<a href="https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/239568/phd-fellow-in-ancient-dna-of-cryptogams-in-northern-ecosystems" target="_blank"><u> PhD position in ancient DNA of cryptogams in northern ecosystems </u></a>is available at the Arctic University Museum of Norway, UiT. You will conduct research as a part of the newly established Norwegian Centre for Arctic Ecosystem Genomics (ArcEcoGen) and will be part of the terrestrial working group.</p>

<p>The position will focus on increasing our understanding of long-term changes in northern ecosystems with a focus on terrestrial and aquatic cryptogams. While we already have explored patterns of vascular plant and mammal sedimentary ancient DNA from many sites in the north, this position will extend the research to other parts of the ecosystem by exploring patterns in cryptogams, such as bryophytes, lichens and other fungi. These data will be explored to include trait analyses and other proxies, which will increase our understanding of different environmental drivers on ecosystem development and changes.</p>

<p>The position is for a period of four years. The nominal length of the PhD programme is three years. The fourth year is distributed as 25 % each year and will consist of teaching and other duties. The objective of the position is to complete research training to the level of a doctoral degree. Admission to the PhD programme is a prerequisite for employment, and the programme period starts on commencement of the position.</p>

<p><a href="https://iapetus2.ac.uk/studentships/time-travelling-with-ancient-dna-revealing-past-adaptations-of-plants-to-changes-in-atmospheric-temperature-and-co2-levels-2/" target="_blank"><u> A invite applications to a PhD project </u></a> at Newcastle University (UK) that will look at long-term changes in CO2 fixing enzyme (Rubisco) in plant species. Rubisco controls carbon fixation and is strongly temperature-dependent. Little is known about how changes in temperature and CO2 between glacial-interglacial cycles have affected the genetic adaptation of Rubisco. This project aims to use well-preserved plant remains from Late-Pleistocene and Holocene sediments to investigate genetic change in Rubisco, which will be crucial for understanding the speed at which plants can adapt their carbon fixation to future increases in temperature and CO2. <b> Please note</b> that this is a competitive call for funding and that funding success depends mainly on the strength of the shortlisted applicant.
