<p>The Department of Geological Sciences at Stockholm University invites applications for a four-year PhD position based at the Centre for Palaeogenetics (CPG) on the Stockholm University campus.</p> 

<p>The PhD project is part of the First Contact research program funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, with the goal of understanding the impacts of human dispersal on faunal biodiversity. The PhD project will use state-of-the-art ancient DNA techniques from both bones and sediments to reconstruct the evolutionary and ecological histories of animal communities across time intervals that include the first arrival of humans in multiple regions. You can read more about the project <a href="https://kaw.wallenberg.org/en/research/exploring-our-first-meeting-mammoths"><b>here:</b></a>.</p>

<p>The PhD student will join the research group at CPG led by <a href="http://palaeogenetics.com/peter-heintzman/"><b> Peter Heintzman</b></a>. The selected candidate will be expected to publish their results in peer-reviewed scientific journals and present their findings at international/national conferences.</p>
