<b>About the research project</b>
 
Antarctic krill are vastly abundant crustaceans in the Southern Ocean, where they are a critical ecosystem component linking plankton to predators and contributing to biogeochemical cycles. Climate change, and in particular, winter sea-ice habitat reduction and ocean acidification, as well as an increasing krill fishery, could lead to a population decline of this keystone species. To assess the potential impacts on krill population sustainability and resilience, studies investigating past records of environmentally driven krill population dynamics are crucial. To date, such paleo-studies targeting krill have been impossible as krill leave no fossil record for microscopic investigation, however, with recent technological advances in sedimentary ancient DNA research (sedaDNA), such studies can now be realised. In fact, the application of sedaDNA analyses to reconstruct Antarctic marine ecosystems has already been shown, including the possibility to extract ancient DNA from crustaceans. This research will build on these already existing sedaDNA techniques and target Antarctic krill specifically. The latter will be achieved by applying an RNA based hybridisation-capture technique, a method that has been commonly used in ancient DNA research to capture very degraded and fragmented sequences. The capture approach will target krill for the first time, to investigate their dynamics over thousands of years. This research will fill an important gap in our understanding of how Antarctic krill responded to past environmental change - knowledge that will improve predictions about future adaptation to ongoing climate change.
