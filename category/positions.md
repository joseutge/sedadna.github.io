<p> A <b> two-year Post-Doctoral fellowship </b> is available in the field of southern African archaeology and ancient DNA, to be hosted by the <b>Centre for Microbial Ecology and Genomics at the University of Pretoria</b>, South Africa. The candidate will analyse shotgun metagenomic datasets generated from the sequencing of sedimentary and other ancient samples derived from southern African archaeological contexts, spanning the Holocene and Late Pleistocene epochs. In general terms, the candidate will explore whether molecular (sedaDNA) analyses could provide insight into ancient African human ecology. More specifically, the candidate will aim to detect traces ancient human bacterial and viral pathogens, and explore the evolutionary history of infectious diseases in prehistoric southern Africa. The ideal candidate will have a Ph.D. in bioinformatics or a closely related field, and demonstrate abilities to work both independently and in a team environment, with an emphasis on strong expertise in the molecular tools used in next-generation sequencing and population genomics. The candidate should have background in molecular biology, particularly in molecular methods for generating large-scale sequence and SNP datasets, and be familiar with basic concepts in computational science and optionally, with Bash or other programming languages such as R, Perl and or Python. Experience in the analysis of ancient DNA and/or Next-Generation Sequencing will be considered positively. Expressions of interest must be submitted electronically to <b><u> riaanrifkin@gmail.com </u></b>. Please include the following: (1) A Curriculum Vitae (with publication record, if any), (2) A Letter of Motivation of no longer than two pages, and (3) Contact details of two professional references. Our review of submitted expressions of interest will continue until the position is filled. The appointment is expected to commence in January 2023. </p>

The applicant will join an international team of researchers on the project “IceAGenT - Ice Age Genomic Tracking of Refugia and Postglacial Dispersal” financed by ERC. The main goal is to forecast the effect of environmental change on future species distribution and genetic diversity. The applicant will be given access to a unique large-scale ancient DNA dataset that can be combined with advances in machine learning technics. Sedimentary ancient DNA provides high-resolution time series from the past. The post doc will use a sedaDNA dataset covering the regions of Iceland, Svalbard, Fennoscandia, Polar Ural and south to the Alps. Both plant and mammals’ data are available from around 50 sediment cores, as well as climate reconstructions. The <b> aplication deadline </b>is the <b>16th of November 2022 </b>. <a href="https://stilling.forskning.no/job-ads-postdoc-troms-og-finnmark/postdoctoral-fellow-in-modeling-using-ancient-sedimentary-dna-data/2097481" target="_blank"><u> For more information click here </u></a></p>

Rubisco controls carbon fixation and is strongly temperature-dependent. Little is known about how changes in temperature and CO2 between glacial-interglacial cycles have affected the genetic adaptation of Rubisco. This project aims to use well-preserved plant remains from Late-Pleistocene and Holocene sediments to investigate genetic change in Rubisco, which will be crucial for understanding the speed at which plants can adapt their carbon fixation to future increases in temperature and CO2. <b> Please note</b> that this is a competitive call for funding and that funding success depends mainly on the strength of the shortlisted applicant.
