<p>4 year Phd position</p>

<p>A 4 year position is availbile at the Arctic University of Norway. The PhD will be part of the Norwegian Centre for Arctic Ecosystem Genomics (ArcEcoGen) at the Arctic University Museum, UiT, Troms√∏. ArcEcoGen centre focuses on the combined effect of humans, climate, and biota on northern ecosystem dynamics in the past, present, and future using environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques.</p>

<p>The largest impact of climate change currently seen on arctic vegetation is the northwards expansion of shrub tundra. However, shrubs may be impacted by a range of factors such as herbivory, snow cover, moisture, and temperatures, and the long-term impact are not well known. Ancient DNA has recently revolutionised our understanding of effect of past climate changes as it provides a local vegetation signal of high taxonomic resolution. Unfortunately, the dominant shrub genera, birch (Betula) and willow (Salix), are rarely distinguished to species level in ancient DNA studies. This PhD will focus on 1) develop methods for species level identification of shrubs from lake sediments, and 2) use latitudinal gradients of sedimentary ancient DNA to study past effects of environmental changes on arctic greening.<a href="https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/256742/phd-fellow-in-plant-ecology-and-evolution"><b> See here for more information</b></a></p>

<p>30-month post-doc </p>
A 30-month post-doc researcher (can be extended) is available in Bergen on the project BIOcean5D, a pan-European EU-funded consortia:
"BIOcean5D unites major European centres in molecular and cell biology; marine biology; and sequencing, together with 31 partners from 11 countries, to build a unique suite of technologies, protocols, and models allowing holistic re-exploration of marine biodiversity, from viruses to mammals, from genomes to holobionts, across multiple spatial and temporal scales, stretching from pre-industrial history to today. "</p>

<p> The post-doc project aims at mining global-scale metagenomics datasets of plankton and sediment biodiversity, to analyse the patterns of marine biodiversity from the sunlit surface to the deep-ocean floor. The main objective is to get a better understanding of the plankton communities that contribute most to carbon sequestration in the deep ocean. Another objective is to develop a better understanding of diverse and inconspicuous deep-sea benthic biodiversity using omics methods. </p>

<p>Further development towards sedimentary ancient DNA in marine settings are expected. </p>

<p>Starting date: June / July 2024. </p>
<p><b>Application deadline:</b> The review process will start immediately and the position will remain open until filled. </p>

<p>PhD position</p>
<p>A full-time PhD position is available in the fields of marine microbial ecology, paleogenomics and bioinformatics at <a href="https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/258181/phd-research-fellow-in-marine-microbial-ecology"><b> NORCE Climate and Environment</b></a> in Bergen, Norway.</p>

<p>The research will focus on the impact of past environmental change on marine microbial diversity in Norwegian and Arctic fjords using sedimentary ancient DNA. The position is available from 01.09.2024 and for a fixed-term period of 3 years. The position will be located at NORCE, and you will be enrolled as a PhD student at the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Bergen. <a href="https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/258181/phd-research-fellow-in-marine-microbial-ecology"><b> See here for more information</b></a></p>
