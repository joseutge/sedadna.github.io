<p><a href="https://iapetus2.ac.uk/studentships/time-travelling-with-ancient-dna-revealing-past-adaptations-of-plants-to-changes-in-atmospheric-temperature-and-co2-levels-2/" target="_blank"><u> A invite applications to a PhD project </u></a> at Newcastle University (UK) that will look at long-term changes in CO2 fixing enzyme (Rubisco) in plant species. Rubisco controls carbon fixation and is strongly temperature-dependent. Little is known about how changes in temperature and CO2 between glacial-interglacial cycles have affected the genetic adaptation of Rubisco. This project aims to use well-preserved plant remains from Late-Pleistocene and Holocene sediments to investigate genetic change in Rubisco, which will be crucial for understanding the speed at which plants can adapt their carbon fixation to future increases in temperature and CO2. <b> Please note</b> that this is a competitive call for funding and that funding success depends mainly on the strength of the shortlisted applicant. For informal enquiries and more information, please contact <b> Dr Maarten van Hardenbroek</b> (<b>maarten.vanhardenbroek@ncl.ac.uk</b>) or <b>Dr Maxim Kapralov </b>(<b>maxim.kapralov@ncl.ac.uk)</b>.</p>

<p><a href="https://evol.mcmaster.ca/~brian/evoldir/PostDocs/UBuffalo.Paleogenomics_sedaDNA" target="_blank"><u> A Postdoctoral Research Fellowship</u></a> in Paleogenomics/sedaDNA is available as part of a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative project funded by a new 4-year National Science Foundation Understanding the Rules of Life - Emergent Networks award. The project will study Late Pleistocene-Holocene climate change in Southeast Alaska, focusing on rapid warming events following the last glacial maximum. We are a project team of two biology and two geology professors at the University at Buffalo with expertise in the topic and region of study. The Research Fellowship is anticipated to start February, 2023, and be for 2 years with possibility for extension. For more information, please contact <b>Charlotte Lindqvist</b> (cl243@buffalo.edu) and <a href="https://evol.mcmaster.ca/~brian/evoldir/PostDocs/UBuffalo.Paleogenomics_sedaDNA" target="_blank"><u> see here </u></a>
