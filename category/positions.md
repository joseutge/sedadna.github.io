 <p>The <b>Department of Geological Sciences</b> at <b>Stockholm University</b> invites applications for two four-year PhD positions based at the <a href="http://palaeogenetics.com" target="_blank"><u>Centre for Palaeogenetics (CPG)</u></a> on the Stockholm University campus. The PhD projects are part of the DeepTime sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) research program funded by a Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation Academy Fellowship, with the goal of investigating biodiversity turnovers at glacial-interglacial transitions throughout the last 800,000 years. You can read more about the projects here. The PhD students will join the research group at CPG led by <a href="http://palaeogenetics.com/peter-heintzman" target="_blank"><u> Peter Heintzman</u></a>. CPG has world class facilities and expertise for generating and analyzing sedaDNA data. The selected candidates will be expected to publish their results in peer-reviewed scientific journals and present their findings at international/national conferences.</p>

<p><b>Terrestrial ecosystems PhD project:</b> The project will aim to reconstruct plant and animal communities of terrestrial ecosystems from permafrost of northwestern North America, using state-of-the-art sedaDNA techniques. The project will initially focus on Late Pleistocene sediments with the goal of targeting sediments up to 800,000 years old. The project will take advantage of samples already in storage at CPG, with additional fieldwork planned in 2023 and 2024.</p>

<p><b>Marine ecosystems PhD project:</b> The project aims to reconstruct planktonic and benthic communities of marine ecosystems from the Arctic Ocean, using state-of-the-art sedaDNA techniques. The project will initially focus on recent sediments to provide bench-marking data with the goal of targeting sediments up to half a million years old. The project will take advantage of an extensive archive of marine sediment cores housed at the Department of Geological Sciences, with the possibility of additional fieldwork in 2024.</p>  

 The <b> aplication deadline </b>is the <b>15th of January 2023</b>

<p>A three year phd position funded by the NOAA Graduate Assistantship (Ph.D.) in the <a href="https://www.utoledo.edu/nsm/envsciences/grad/" target="_blank"><u> Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Toledo</u></a> is available. The graduate researcher will work with Assistant Professor, <a href="https://www.trishaspanbauer.com" target="_blank"><u>Dr. Trisha Spanbauer </u></a>, to investigate the role of phytoplankton in silica and carbon cycling in the Western Basin of Lake Erie over a range of temporal scales ranging from diurnal to centennial. The successful candidate will develop ancient environmental DNA (aeDNA) datasets from sediments recovered from Lake Erie and evaluate the relationship between major biogeochemical cycles and phytoplankton community dynamics. Other duties will include processing large datasets, mentoring undergraduate students, preparing manuscripts for publication, and delivering presentations at scientific meetings. The start date is May or August 2023. Please send a statement of research interests, unofficial transcripts, and CV to Trisha Spanbauer (<b><u>trisha.spanbauer@utoledo.edu</u></b>) by <b>Jan 15, 2023 </b>, for full consideration. Please put 'Interest in NOAA-funded Graduate Assistantship' in the subject line.

<p> A <b> two-year Post-Doctoral fellowship </b> is available in the field of southern African archaeology and ancient DNA, to be hosted by the <b>Centre for Microbial Ecology and Genomics at the University of Pretoria</b>, South Africa. The candidate will analyse shotgun metagenomic datasets generated from the sequencing of sedimentary and other ancient samples derived from southern African archaeological contexts, spanning the Holocene and Late Pleistocene epochs. In general terms, the candidate will explore whether molecular (sedaDNA) analyses could provide insight into ancient African human ecology. More specifically, the candidate will aim to detect traces ancient human bacterial and viral pathogens, and explore the evolutionary history of infectious diseases in prehistoric southern Africa. The ideal candidate will have a Ph.D. in bioinformatics or a closely related field, and demonstrate abilities to work both independently and in a team environment, with an emphasis on strong expertise in the molecular tools used in next-generation sequencing and population genomics. The candidate should have background in molecular biology, particularly in molecular methods for generating large-scale sequence and SNP datasets, and be familiar with basic concepts in computational science and optionally, with Bash or other programming languages such as R, Perl and or Python. Experience in the analysis of ancient DNA and/or Next-Generation Sequencing will be considered positively. Expressions of interest must be submitted electronically to <b><u> riaanrifkin@gmail.com </u></b>. Please include the following: (1) A Curriculum Vitae (with publication record, if any), (2) A Letter of Motivation of no longer than two pages, and (3) Contact details of two professional references. Our review of submitted expressions of interest will continue until the position is filled. The appointment is expected to commence in January 2023. </p>

<p><a href="https://iapetus2.ac.uk/studentships/time-travelling-with-ancient-dna-revealing-past-adaptations-of-plants-to-changes-in-atmospheric-temperature-and-co2-levels-2/" target="_blank"><u> A invite applications to a PhD project </u></a> at Newcastle University (UK) that will look at long-term changes in CO2 fixing enzyme (Rubisco) in plant species. Rubisco controls carbon fixation and is strongly temperature-dependent. Little is known about how changes in temperature and CO2 between glacial-interglacial cycles have affected the genetic adaptation of Rubisco. This project aims to use well-preserved plant remains from Late-Pleistocene and Holocene sediments to investigate genetic change in Rubisco, which will be crucial for understanding the speed at which plants can adapt their carbon fixation to future increases in temperature and CO2. <b> Please note</b> that this is a competitive call for funding and that funding success depends mainly on the strength of the shortlisted applicant.
