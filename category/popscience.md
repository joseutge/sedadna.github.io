<p> 'Like Jill [Pelto] I like finding new ways to communicate science to a broader audience and especially through art. In these pieces of art Jill used scientific data from our research to increase awareness about what we do and to explain it in a simpler fashion.' - <a href="https://www.laurap.it/" target="_blank"><b>Laura Parducci</b></a>, Assoc. Professor, Dept. of Environmental Biology at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy & Dept. of Plant Ecology at Uppsala University, Sweden</p>
