<p>Dear sed-DNA enthusiasts,</p>
<div class="intro">
<p>
Another productive month has passed, and we slowly moving towards the end of the year. Before we prepair for the holiday season, it is good to note that the abstract application deadline for the INQUA2023 conference in Rome has been extended with four weeks. The new deadline is the 28th of november. There are four sessions covering ancient sedimentary DNA; <a href="https://inquaroma2023.org/conference-sessions/#cea1b432751a8f645" target="_blank"><b>Session 67</b></a>: Exceptional archives: Leveraging visible and non-visible lagerstätten with cutting-edge methods to broaden our knowledge of Quaternary ecosystems,
<a href="https://inquaroma2023.org/conference-sessions/#2ab240bb3d722bf59" target="_blank"><b>Session 90</b></a>: Ancient DNA from Quaternary and Archaeological Sediments, <a href="https://inquaroma2023.org/conference-sessions/#68afda2a6538bfe0a" target="_blank"><b>Session 140</b></a>: Novel molecular tools (biomarkers and DNA) in climatic and environmental archives – challenges, advances, and prospects, and <a href="https://inquaroma2023.org/conference-sessions/#1b42f8ecb32ea21c7" target="_blank"><b>Session 174</b></a>: Tracing the impact of palaeoenvironmental changes in ancient DNA.
</p>
<p>
Further, we will continue the society e-coffee meetings with two new dates, <b>Wednesday 9th </b> of November at 09:00 (UTC+2) and <b>Wednesday the 23th</b> of november at 16:00 (UTC+2) to stimulate interaction between members of the society. Everyone is welcome to join in Gathertown for a digital coffee and social chatting. Calendar invites will be send a few days before via the email list and slack.

<p><a href="https://iapetus2.ac.uk/studentships/time-travelling-with-ancient-dna-revealing-past-adaptations-of-plants-to-changes-in-atmospheric-temperature-and-co2-levels-2/" target="_blank"><u> A invite applications to a PhD project </u></a> at Newcastle University (UK) that will look at long-term changes in CO2 fixing enzyme (Rubisco) in plant species. Rubisco controls carbon fixation and is strongly temperature-dependent. Little is known about how changes in temperature and CO2 between glacial-interglacial cycles have affected the genetic adaptation of Rubisco. This project aims to use well-preserved plant remains from Late-Pleistocene and Holocene sediments to investigate genetic change in Rubisco, which will be crucial for understanding the speed at which plants can adapt their carbon fixation to future increases in temperature and CO2. <b> Please note</b> that this is a competitive call for funding and that funding success depends mainly on the strength of the shortlisted applicant. For informal enquiries and more information, please contact <b> Dr Maarten van Hardenbroek</b> (<b>maarten.vanhardenbroek@ncl.ac.uk</b>) or <b>Dr Maxim Kapralov </b>(<b>maxim.kapralov@ncl.ac.uk)</b>.</p>
