<p>Dear sed-DNA enthusiasts,</p>
<div class="intro">
<p>
Another productive month has passed, and we slowly moving towards the end of the year. Before we prepare for the holiday season, it is good to note that the abstract application deadline for the <a href="https://inquaroma2023.org" target="_blank"><b>INQUA2023</b></a> conference in Rome has been extended by four weeks. The new deadline is the 28th of November. There are four sessions covering ancient sedimentary DNA; <a href="https://inquaroma2023.org/conference-sessions/#cea1b432751a8f645" target="_blank"><b>Session 67</b></a>: Exceptional archives: Leveraging visible and non-visible lagerstätten with cutting-edge methods to broaden our knowledge of Quaternary ecosystems,
<a href="https://inquaroma2023.org/conference-sessions/#2ab240bb3d722bf59" target="_blank"><b>Session 90</b></a>: Ancient DNA from Quaternary and Archaeological Sediments, <a href="https://inquaroma2023.org/conference-sessions/#68afda2a6538bfe0a" target="_blank"><b>Session 140</b></a>: Novel molecular tools (biomarkers and DNA) in climatic and environmental archives – challenges, advances, and prospects, and <a href="https://inquaroma2023.org/conference-sessions/#1b42f8ecb32ea21c7" target="_blank"><b>Session 174</b></a>: Tracing the impact of palaeoenvironmental changes in ancient DNA.
</p>
<p>
Further, we will continue the society e-coffee meetings with two new dates, <b>Wednesday 9th </b> of November at 09:00 (UTC+2) and <b>Wednesday the 23th</b> of November at 16:00 (UTC+2) to stimulate interaction between members of the society. Everyone is welcome to join in Gathertown for a digital coffee and social chatting. Calendar invites will be sent a few days before via the email list and slack.

<p><a href="https://iapetus2.ac.uk/studentships/time-travelling-with-ancient-dna-revealing-past-adaptations-of-plants-to-changes-in-atmospheric-temperature-and-co2-levels-2/" target="_blank"><u> A invite applications to a PhD project </u></a> at Newcastle University (UK) that will look at long-term changes in CO2 fixing enzyme (Rubisco) in plant species. Rubisco controls carbon fixation and is strongly temperature-dependent. Little is known about how changes in temperature and CO2 between glacial-interglacial cycles have affected the genetic adaptation of Rubisco. This project aims to use well-preserved plant remains from Late-Pleistocene and Holocene sediments to investigate genetic change in Rubisco, which will be crucial for understanding the speed at which plants can adapt their carbon fixation to future increases in temperature and CO2. <b> Please note</b> that this is a competitive call for funding and that funding success depends mainly on the strength of the shortlisted applicant. For informal enquiries and more information, please contact <b> Dr Maarten van Hardenbroek</b> (<b>maarten.vanhardenbroek@ncl.ac.uk</b>) or <b>Dr Maxim Kapralov </b>(<b>maxim.kapralov@ncl.ac.uk)</b>.</p>

  <p> A two year Postdoctoral Research Fellow position is available at the Arctic University Museum of Norway. The applicant will join an international team of researchers on the project “IceAGenT - Ice Age Genomic Tracking of Refugia and Postglacial Dispersal” financed by ERC. The main goal is to forecast the effect of environmental change on future species distribution and genetic diversity. The applicant will be given access to a unique large-scale ancient DNA dataset that can be combined with advances in machine learning technics. Sedimentary ancient DNA provides high-resolution time series from the past. The post doc will use a sedaDNA dataset covering the regions of Iceland, Svalbard, Fennoscandia, Polar Ural and south to the Alps. Both plant and mammals’ data are available from around 50 sediment cores, as well as climate reconstructions. The <b> aplication deadline </b>is the <b>16th of November 2022 </b>. <a href="https://stilling.forskning.no/job-ads-postdoc-troms-og-finnmark/postdoctoral-fellow-in-modeling-using-ancient-sedimentary-dna-data/2097481" target="_blank"><u> For more information click here </u></a></p>
