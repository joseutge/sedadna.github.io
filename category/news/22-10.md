<h4 class="section-title underline">New Positions</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/southern-ocean-sedadna/_nocache" target="_blank"><u> A PhD position</u></a> on the influence of palaeo-climatic changes on Southern Ocean biodiversity at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), University of Tasmania, Australia. The project will focus on (1) developing bioinformatic approaches for analysing and validating metagenomic sedaDNA, and (2) reconstructing millennia-scale records of biodiversity presence at key sites in the Southern Ocean and placing these into context with palaeoclimatic records to identify key environmental drivers associated with shifts in biodiversity. <b> Application deadline 10th of October 2022</b> <a href="https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/southern-ocean-sedadna/_nocache" target="_blank"><u>. klick here for more information </u></a>

<p><a href="https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/antarctic-krill-sedadna/_nocache" target="_blank"><u> A PhD position</u></a> on the Probing ancient Antarctic krill populations at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), University of Tasmania, Australia.This research will build on these already existing sedaDNA techniques and target Antarctic krill specifically. The latter will be achieved by applying an RNA based hybridisation-capture technique, a method that has been commonly used in ancient DNA research to capture very degraded and fragmented sequences. The capture approach will target krill for the first time, to investigate their dynamics over thousands of years.<b> Application deadline 15th of October 2022</b>. <a href="https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/antarctic-krill-sedadna/_nocache" target="_blank"><u> klick here for more information </u></a>

<p> <b>A 3-year PhD position </b> on the diversity, paleoecology and evolution of Cyanobacteria inAntarctic lakes at the University of Liège, in the group of<a href="https://www.inbios.uliege.be/cms/c_9942774/en/inbios-cyanobacterial-molecular-diversity-and-ecology" target="_blank"><u> Annick Wilmotte </u></a>. The students will use fossil DNA in selected lake sediments and develop molecular phylogenies of focal
cyanobacterial taxa to study the processes that contributed to the present-day diversity of
microorganisms and invertebrates in Antarctic lakes. The processes studied include the long-term
persistence of biota in glacial refugia, and extinction, colonization, diversification and biological
succession in response to past climate and environmental changes. For more information, please contact <b>Annick Wilmotte</b> (awilmotte@uliege.be) <b> Application deadline 10th of October 2022</b>

<p>A <a href="https://homepage.univie.ac.at/mareike.stahlschmidt/?page_id=36" target="_blank"><u> 4-year post-doctoral position </u></a>(UM) is available, focused on analyzing archaeological sediments and speleothems in the framework of the ERC St G project “MicroStratDNA” Reconstructing Paleolithic Population Dynamics Using Microstratified Paleogenomics” by <b>M. Stahlschmidt </b> and in collaboration with the <b>Pinhasi Lab</b> at the <b>University of Vienna</b>. MicroStratDNA is positioned at the intersection of geoarchaeology and archaeogenomics and concerned with the formation history of environmental sources of DNA pertaining to archaeological questions and with a focus on human aDNA.<b> Application deadline 15th of October 2022</b>.<a href="https://homepage.univie.ac.at/mareike.stahlschmidt/" target="_blank"><u> More information</u></a></p>

<p><a href="https://evol.mcmaster.ca/~brian/evoldir/PostDocs/UBuffalo.Paleogenomics_sedaDNA" target="_blank"><u> A Postdoctoral Research Fellowship</u></a> in Paleogenomics/sedaDNA is available as part of a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative project funded by a new 4-year National Science Foundation Understanding the Rules of Life - Emergent Networks award. The project will study Late Pleistocene-Holocene climate change in Southeast Alaska, focusing on rapid warming events following the last glacial maximum. We are a project team of two biology and two geology professors at the University at Buffalo with expertise in the topic and region of study. The Research Fellowship is anticipated to start February, 2023, and be for 2 years with possibility for extension.
