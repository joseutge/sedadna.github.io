<h3 class="section-title underline">December 2022 Newsletter</h3>
</div>

<p>Dear sed-DNA enthusiasts,</p>
<div class="intro">
<p> This is the last newsletter of 2022. The news of the passing of <b>Sarah Crump</b> prompted into a large number of messages from society members. We compiled these messages and are displayed on a page dedicated to Sarah (https://sedadna.github.io/category/sarah_crump.html). There are also likes to her research papers.  

<p>We wish already wish everyone happy holidays, and all the best for the New year. 

<p>We would like to highlight that Ines Angeles Barrenechea, member of the student board, successfully defended her PhD</p>

</p>
<p>
We will have one more society e-coffee in december, <b> Wednesday the 7th </b> of December at 09:00 (UTC+2). Everyone is welcome to join in Gathertown for a digital coffee and social chatting. Calendar invites will be sent a few days before via the email list and the society slack channel.
