<div class="intro">
<p> Dear sed-DNA enthusiasts,</p>
<p>Three years have passed since the formation of the Sediment Ancient DNA Society. We cannot believe how fast the time is going. We have now reached 454 members, the number is still slowly growing every month. We are very happy to see how society has developed and keeps on developing, especially for early career scientists. Many collaborations have been established, which would only be possible with such an opening and welcoming community, we hope to keep doing this for many more years to come.</p>

<p>As usual, papers published and pre-prints in the previous month are listed below.</p>
