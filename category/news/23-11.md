<p>Dear sed-DNA enthusiasts,</p>
<div class="intro">
<p> Autumn has taken its hold, and we are slowly moving towards the winter in the northern hemisphere. Like last month, there are no announcements from the society. We are still hosting every month early career seminars with high attendance in different time zones. If you are new to the society, or a PI with new students, or want to get more involved as an early career researcher you can add your name to the  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Ki-NjTdcYrjRnWvVH31Rwfk63BM7b3PaHIxwDQJ71c/edit#gid=0" target="_blank"><b>list here</b></a>. We are still working on bringing back the general seminar series in a different format. We will send more information about this later this year. </p> 

<p>Please let me know if I missed a paper or preprint, or simply paste a link or DOI <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-8Wct-4bm0t0U4gApA92XDzlRM1B1WgIJdi-ihtWEcI/prefill" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>
