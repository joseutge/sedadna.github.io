<p>Dear sed-DNA enthusiasts,</p>
<div class="intro">
<p>Yesterday, the meteorological summer or winter started depending on your location in the world. We would like to highlight again that the first SedDNA Meeting is taking place this week at the AWI (Alfred Wegener Institute) in Potsdam, Germany. This will be a great event with 120 participants!</p>

<p>Furthermore, we are pleased to announce the publication of the latest collaborative project by members of the sedaDNA society, titled "Strengthening global-change science by integrating aeDNA with paleoecoinformatics," led by Jack Williams. This research has been published this month in <i>Trends in Ecology & Evolution</i> and is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534723001234?dgcid=author" target="_blank"><b>available here</b></a>.</p>

<p>There will be no e-coffees this month, but I hope to see many of you at the sedDNA meeting next week.</p>

<h4 class="section-title underline">New Positions</h4>

<p>A <b>two-year post-doctoral fellowship </b> in computational palaeogenomics is availible at the Vrije universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands. The position is mainly focused on bioinformatic analyses of sedaDNA but aslo a small set of human aDNA samples. The project is part of the <a href="https://c-limes.nl" target="_blank"><b> "Constructing the Limes" </b></a> project in the Netherlands. See <a href="https://www.earthworks-jobs.com/geoscience/vu23051" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a> for more information</p>

<p>The application <b>deadline is 1st of July 2023</b></p>

<p> A Post-doc position at McGill University, Canada, starting January, 2024. The Project includes using sedDNA to reconstruct ecosystem dynamics of sockeye salmon nursery lakes in BC (Canada) over the past ~200 years. Ideal candidates would have experience in molecular biology and bioinformatics. Contact Dr. Irene Gregory-Eaves for more information at irene.<u>gregory-eaves@mcgill.ca</u>.
