<h3 class="section-title underline">December 2021 Newsletter</h3>
</div>

<p>Dear sed-DNA enthusiasts,</p>

<p>This is the first version of the newsletter that is sent through the google groups, rather than the MailChimp tool that you are used to. To make the mails less cumbersome to read and run less risk the mails will end up in the spam folders. We are now only sending the general introduction of the newsletter through the mail every first Friday of the month with a single web link to the specific edition of the newsletter on the new society website. </p>

<p>We as the organization and advisory board would like to already send wish you a great holiday season. Many new initiatives will be starting in the new year! </p>
