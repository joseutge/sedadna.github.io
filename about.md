Mersorcium is an international network that originates from the [**Meta-Hg working group**](https://ercapo.wixsite.com/meta-hg), created in 2020 by Eric Capo, a collaborative project aiming to promote best practices in the detection and identification of Hg-cycling genes from environmental genomic data. The first outcome of the Meta-Hg working group is the release of the version 1 Hg-MATE database, a *hgcAB* gene catalogue ([Gionfriddo et al. 2021](https://smithsonian.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Hg-MATE-Db_v1_01142021/13105370/1?file=26193689)). As a continuation to this work, researchers from Mersorcium aim to augment this database with information about *merA* and *merB* genes.
